# **MSnbase**, efficient and elegant R-based processing and  visualisation of raw mass spectrometry data

We present version 2 of the **MSnbase** R/Bioconductor
package. **MSnbase** provides infrastructure for the manipulation,
processing and visualisation of mass spectrometry data. We focus on
the new *on-disk* infrastructure, that allows the handling of large
raw mass spectrometry experiment on commodity hardware and illustrate
how the package is used for elegant data processing, method
development and visualisation.

The code to reproduce the analyses and figures are 

- `S01-ondisk.R`
- `S02-boxcar.R`
