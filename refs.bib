		    acquisition speed on the Orbitrap mass analyzer,
		    enabling increasingly deep proteome
		    coverage. However, these advances have been mainly
		    limited to the MS2 level, whereas ion beam sampling
		    for the MS1 scans remains extremely
		    inefficient. Here we report a data-acquisition
		    method, termed BoxCar, in which filling multiple
		    narrow mass-to-charge segments increases the mean
		    ion injection time more than tenfold as compared to
		    that of a standard full scan. In 1-h analyses, the
		    method provided MS1-level evidence for more than
		    90{\%} of the proteome of a human cancer cell line
		    that had previously been identified in 24 fractions,
		    and it quantified more than 6,200 proteins in ten of
		    ten replicates. In mouse brain tissue, we detected
		    more than 10,000 proteins in only 100 min, and
		    sensitivity extended into the low-attomolar range.",

  abstract = {Metabolomics aims to measure and characterise the complex composition of metabolites in a biological system. Metabolomics studies involve sophisticated analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and generate large amounts of high-dimensional and complex experimental data. Open source processing and analysis tools are of major interest in light of innovative, open and reproducible science. The scientific community has developed a wide range of open source software, providing freely available advanced processing and analysis approaches. The programming and statistics environment R has emerged as one of the most popular environments to process and analyse Metabolomics datasets. A major benefit of such an environment is the possibility of connecting different tools into more complex workflows. Combining reusable data processing R scripts with the experimental data thus allows for open, reproducible research. This review provides an extensive overview of existing packages in R for different steps in a typical computational metabolomics workflow, including data processing, biostatistics, metabolite annotation and identification, and biochemical network and pathway analysis. Multifunctional workflows, possible user interfaces and integration into workflow management systems are also reviewed. In total, this review summarises more than two hundred metabolomics specific packages primarily available on CRAN, Bioconductor and GitHub.},
