  abstract = "Great advances have been made in sensitivity and
                    acquisition speed on the Orbitrap mass analyzer,
                    enabling increasingly deep proteome
                    coverage. However, these advances have been mainly
                    limited to the MS2 level, whereas ion beam sampling
                    for the MS1 scans remains extremely
                    inefficient. Here we report a data-acquisition
                    method, termed BoxCar, in which filling multiple
                    narrow mass-to-charge segments increases the mean
                    ion injection time more than tenfold as compared to
                    that of a standard full scan. In 1-h analyses, the
                    method provided MS1-level evidence for more than
                    90{\%} of the proteome of a human cancer cell line
                    that had previously been identified in 24 fractions,
                    and it quantified more than 6,200 proteins in ten of
                    ten replicates. In mouse brain tissue, we detected
                    more than 10,000 proteins in only 100 min, and
                    sensitivity extended into the low-attomolar range.",
