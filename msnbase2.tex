\begin{abstract} %% 200 words max
  We present version 2 of the \texttt{MSnbase} R/Bioconductor
  package. \texttt{MSnbase} provides infrastructure for the
  manipulation, processing and visualisation of mass spectrometry
  data. Here we present how the new \textit{on disk} infrastructure
  allows the handling of hundreds on commodity hardware and present
  some application of the package.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}

What is \texttt{MSnbase}: \texttt{MSnbase} \cite{Gatto:2012} offers a
solution between low level liraries such as jmzml, exclusively for the
development of new applications and GUI software, that provides a
limited and fixed set of functionality.



\section{Software functionality}


\subsection{On disk backend}

Efficient low level access: in memory vs on disk mode (using mzR),
benchmarking, used in ms-based proteomics and metabolomics.

\subsection{Use cases}

Example applications: visualisation, ...
